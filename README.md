# rod-zoom
## Zoom prototype

The demo is available [here](https://rod-zoom.herokuapp.com)

The pandemic is an unprecedented event. It has alienated us, it has changed our habits, it has changed the way we live.
This project is made with the intention of remembering this event by making a prototype of one of the most used tools at that time.

Built in NodeJS i'm using Socket.io and Peer.JS for communication

If you want to use it, just clone and run npm install
